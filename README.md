# SGDA Optimization using train_SGDA.py

This repository contains an implementation of SGDA optimization using the `train_SGDA.py` script.

## Introduction

SGDA stands for smoothed gradient descent-ascent and is a popular optimization algorithm for nonconvex-concave problems arising in machine learning applications such as robust adversarial training of neural networks.

The `train_SGDA.py` script implements the SGDA optimization algorithm and can be used to train models for a variety of machine learning tasks.

## Installation

To use the `train_SGDA.py` script, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
